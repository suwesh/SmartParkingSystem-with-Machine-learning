# SmartParkingSystem-with-Machine-learning
An IoT based Smart Parking System with Real-time slot allocation and slot availability prediction

Two models are used to predict the probability of slot availability individually. When compared, the Multi-Layer Perceptron gives slots with more probability of availability compared to the Random Forest Classifier.

IOT level 4 architecture:
